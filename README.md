Revamp-Framework
================

Foundation v5 for Joomla 3.x

Revamp is a simple template development framework / starter template built on Foundation5 from Zurb to provide a robust, mobile first approach to responsive design.  We have been working on it on our own websites, and decided to share.

Make sure you check out our website at http://revamp.schramdesignteam.com

Revamp Framework is based on SiegeEngine2, and was created to allow easy styling using a built in Sass Compiler, complete control of module positions, sizes, and colors, and a easy to use template on which to build your site.

Want to help make Revamp even better?  Fork our repo on Github and send us a pull request, send us a donation, or just [let us know](mailto:revamp@schramdesignteam.com) about your experience using Revamp.
